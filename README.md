## Abstract
In the trend of automation for industry - we refer to Industry 4.0 - factories are becoming more and more digitized and interconnected. Thanks to IoT (Internet of Things) and UWB indoor positioning technologies, it is possible to meet the need to locate and monitor objects or people inside a building with an accuracy that cannot be achieved with other technologies such as GNSS services. The collaboration with UNISET for this thesis is part of this industrial structure. The aim of the project was to make a video surveillance system (fixed and adjustable cameras) interact with the RTLS positioning system based on UWB technology developed by the company, which provides the XYZ coordinates of a device inside a building. The software developed makes it possible to monitor with cameras the positions of a user moving in an indoor environment equipped with tags, so as to make a selection of the cameras to be used according to the environment where the tagged subject is located and to be able to follow the movements through motorized cameras.
